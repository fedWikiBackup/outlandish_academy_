Team learning is process of adapting and developing the team capacity to create the results that its members really want. Team learning requires individuals to engage in dialogue and discussion; therefore team members must develop open communication, shared meaning, and shared understanding. Learning organizations typically have excellent knowledge management structures, allowing creation, acquisition, dissemination, and implementation of this knowledge in the organization. Teams use tools such as an [[action learning]] cycle and [[dialogue]]. Team learning is only one element of the [[learning cycle]]. For the cycle to be complete, it has to include all five characteristics which are mentioned above - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_organization#Team_learning wikipedia]"

      "text": "The product owner represents the product's [[Stakeholder (corporate)]] and the [[voice of the customer]], is responsible for the backlog and accountable for maximising the value that the team delivers. The product owner defines the product in customer-centric terms (typically [[user story]]), adds them to the [[Scrum (software development)#Product backlog]], and [[Requirement prioritization]] them based on importance and dependencies. A scrum team should have only one product owner (although a product owner could support more than one team). This role should not be combined with that of the scrum master. The product owner should focus on the business side of product development and spend the majority of their time liaising with stakeholders and should not dictate how the team reaches a technical solution. This role is equivalent to the [[customer representative]] role in some other agile frameworks such as [[extreme programming]] (XP) - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)#Product_owner wikipedia]"

The ability to convey priorities and empathize with team members and stakeholders is vital to steer product development in the right direction. The product owner role bridges the communication gap between the team and its stakeholders, serving as a proxy for stakeholders to the team and as a team representative to the overall stakeholder community."

The daily scrum:\n- * starts precisely on time even if some development team members are missing\n- * should happen at the same time and place every day\n- * is limited ([[timeboxing|timeboxed]]) to fifteen minutes\n-  Anyone is welcome, though only development team members should contribute.\n-  During the daily scrum, each team member typically answers three questions:\n- * What did I complete yesterday that contributed to the team meeting our sprint goal?\n- * What do I plan to complete today to contribute to the team meeting our sprint goal?\n- * Do I see any impediment that could prevent me or the team from meeting our sprint goal?"

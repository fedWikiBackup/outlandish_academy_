It was working on a multimedia story on Kon-Tiki and THor Heyerdahl`s travels to Easter Islands [https://www.kon-tiki.no/expeditions/easter-island-expedition/?lang=nb source], when a friend called on me and asked me to type wwww for the first time. I understood like in an instant that these 3 letters of www would change the world and to connect all computers in a web and in this a way  connecting all brains of the world to the same mega-computer-system. I had read about it, but never typed the www of the world wide web before. I will describe it as one of these Aureka moments in my life. "
